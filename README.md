# BananaCatShooter

A 2D shooting game where the player controls a cat and shoots bullets to eliminate enemy cats while avoiding collisions. The game has multiple states, including a start menu, gameplay, and a game over screen.

It doesn't work as of currently due to continuous bugs and isn't perfect.
